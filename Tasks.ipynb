The aim is to get an integer square root, similar to what was attempted above but with the Newtonian method. By using floor division to get the mean for each successive estimate, it avoids the use of floating point numbers altogether, and thus the issues that arise with them. The code continues to refine the estimation until the old and new estimates match, which occurs once the number of digits required is reached. The returned integer value is 101 digits long, including the number that will fall in front of the decimal. To present the final answer, the returned vale of this function is reformatted as a string to include a decimal point.    "

    "Based on this plot, it looks like White Collar workers are more likely to live in neighbourhood D than Blue Collar workers while Blue Collar workers are more likely to live in neighbourhood B than White Collar workers. But can it be said based on this observation that there is a significant relationship here?\n",
    "\n",
    "A null hypothesis assumes there is no relationship between these variables, that the neighbourhood a person lives in is not related to their occupation, while an alternative hypothesis would assume there is some kind of association between them. The Chi-squared test calculates the values that would be expected from the sample at each data point if the null hypothesis were true and compares them to the actual observed values. Expected values are calculated for each data point by multiplying the total of a column by the total of a row and dividing it by the population of the sample. For example, to calculate the expected number of White Collar workers that live in neighbourhood D if these variables were independent, we would need to multiply the total of column D (150) by the total of the White Collar row (349) and divide it by the total of the sample (650). https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi-squared_test\n",
    "\n",
    "$${\\frac{150 * 349}{650} = 80.54}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The expected value at this data point is 80.54 but the observed value is 95 meaning there is a difference of 14.46 between them. One of the results of a Chi-squared test is the Chi-squared statistic, which represents the differences between the observed and expected values for the whole dataset in a single value. The closer this value is to zero, the more aligned the observed and expected values are, and therefore it is more likely that the variables are independent from one another since they would be echoing the values determined by an assumption that the null hypothesis is true. https://www.statisticshowto.com/probability-and-statistics/chi-square/ \n",
    "\n",
    "At its most basic, the formula for the Chi-squared statistic is the sum of the squared difference between the observed and expected values for each data point divided by the expected values https://www.statisticshowto.com/probability-and-statistics/chi-square/:\n",
    "\n",
    "$${\\chi}^2=\\sum\\frac{(O_i - E_i)^2}{E_i}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this statistic alone is not enough to indicate the independence of the variables - the significance of this value needs to be determined.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **p-value** indicates the statistical significance of the Chi-squared value. It represents the probability that any extreme  differences seen between the observed and expected values occurred as a result of random chance. https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/p-value.asp In other words, what are the chances that the actual values would have been measured if the variables were truly independent of one another? The smaller a p-value, the lower these chances and the more evidence there is to support the alternative hypothesis that there is a relationship between the variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **critical value** represents a point beyond which the null hypothesis can be rejected, i.e. if the Chi-squared statistic is greater than this value, it is unlikely that the variables are independent  https://www.statisticssolutions.com/non-parametric-analysis-chi-square/. A Chi-square table (below) can be used to determine the critical value, which is based on the degrees of freedom and the significance level.\n",
    "\n",
    "![ChiSquareTable](https://www.statology.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/chi_square_table_small.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The **degrees of freedom** is a simple calculation that refers to the maximum number of independent values in the dataset that have the freedom to vary https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/degrees-of-freedom.asp In this case it is the multiplication of the number of rows (minus 1) and the number of columns (minus one): (4-1)(3-1) = 6  \n",
    "\n",
    "The **significance level** is related to the p-value. It is an arbitrary point, decided by researchers prior to beginning an analysis, below which they have determined the null hypothesis can be rejected https://www.statsdirect.com/help/basics/p_values.htm. If the p-value falls below the significance level, researchers can reject the null hypothesis and suspect that there may be a relationship between the variables. The significance level can be any value between 0 and 1 but typically values of 0.1, 0.05 or 0.01 are used as the threshold  http://www.stat.yale.edu/Courses/1997-98/101/sigtest.htm . A p-value below a significance level of 0.05 indicates that there is a less than 5% chance that the null hypothesis is correct and that the observed data is a result of random chance. \n",
    "\n",
    "With a value of 6 degrees of freedom and significance levels of 0.1, 0.05, and 0.01 the table above suggests the critical value would be 10.645, 12.592 and 16.812 respectively for each of these values. As the significance level value gets smaller, the critical value gets larger https://www.statology.org/chi-square-critical-value-python/ The task description states that the Chi-squared value of the data above should be 24.6 and so it looks like the null hypothesis will be rejected based on these critical values across the different significance levels.
