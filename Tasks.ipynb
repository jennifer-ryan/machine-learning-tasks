The aim is to get an integer square root, similar to what was attempted above, through the Newtonian method. By using floor division to get the mean for each successive estimate, it avoids the use of floating point numbers altogether, and thus the issues that arise with them. The code continues to refine the estimation until the old and new estimates match, which occurs once the number of digits required is reached. The returned integer value is 101 digits long, including the number that will fall in front of the decimal.
